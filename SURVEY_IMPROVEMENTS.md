# Survey Functionality Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Visual Feedback for All Question Types
- **File**: `wtestapp/templates/wtestapp/survey_detail.html`
- **Changes**:

#### A. Yes/No Questions (`handleYesNoChange()`)
  - When user clicks Yes/No:
    - Question section turns green (#d4edda) with left border
    - Displays green checkmark icon
    - Auto-resets after 2 seconds
    - Console logs the answer

#### B. Radio Button Questions (`handleRadioChange()`)
  - When user selects an option:
    - Shows green checkmark next to selected option
    - Question section briefly highlights in light green (#e8f5e9)
    - Checkmark fades out after 1.5 seconds
    - Background resets after 0.8 seconds
    - Console logs the selection

#### C. Checkbox Questions (`handleCheckboxChange()`)
  - **IMPORTANT: Checkboxes now behave like radio buttons (single-select only)**
  - When user checks an option:
    - Automatically unchecks any previously selected option
    - Shows green checkmark on newly selected option
    - Removes checkmark from previously selected option
    - Question section briefly highlights
    - Checkmark disappears after 1.5 seconds
  - User can click same checkbox again to uncheck it
  - Only ONE option can be selected at a time (like radio buttons)
  - Backend saves single value, not comma-separated list

### 2. All Questions are Now Mandatory
- **Frontend** (`survey_detail.html`):
  - Added red asterisk (*) to all question titles
  - Added `required` attribute to all input fields:
    - Text inputs
    - Textareas
    - Radio buttons (Yes/No)
    - Number inputs
    - Email inputs
    - Phone inputs

- **Backend** (`views.py`):
  - Line 243: Changed `is_required` to always be `True`
  - Added comprehensive validation before survey submission (lines 212-241):
    - Validates all JSON questions
    - Validates all database questions
    - Checks text, radio, checkbox, and other field types
    - Shows up to 3 error messages if validation fails
    - Prevents submission if any required field is empty

### 3. Backend Validation
- **File**: `wtestapp/views.py`
- **Function**: `survey_detail()` (lines 212-241)
- **Logic**:
  1. Only validates on "Submit" (not "Save Draft")
  2. Loops through all questions
  3. Checks if answer is empty or contains only whitespace
  4. Collects validation errors
  5. Shows error messages and redirects back to survey if validation fails
  6. Allows submission only if all questions are answered

### 4. Answer Saving Mechanism
- **Already Working**: Lines 256-261 & 282-287
- Uses `Answer.objects.update_or_create()` to:
  - Create new answer if doesn't exist
  - Update existing answer if already exists
  - Links to `SurveyResponse` and `Question` models
  - Stores answer in `answer_text` field

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. **Opens Survey** → Sees all questions with red asterisks (*)
2. **Clicks Yes/No** → Question section turns green briefly with checkmark
3. **Fills All Fields** → Required validation ensures no field is skipped
4. **Clicks "Save Draft"** → Saves current progress (no validation)
5. **Clicks "Submit Survey"** → Backend validates all fields
   - If any field is empty: Shows error, stays on page
   - If all filled: Saves to database, marks survey as complete

### Database Storage:
- **Answer Model** fields:
  - `survey_response`: Links to SurveyResponse
  - `question`: Links to Question
  - `answer_text`: Stores the actual answer
  - `created_at`: Timestamp

## Future JSON Support
The system is already prepared for future JSON questions:
- Automatically normalizes question format from JSON
- Supports multiple field types: text, textarea, radio, checkbox, yesno, number, email, phone
- Maps common aliases (e.g., "single" → "radio", "boolean" → "yesno")
- Validates JSON questions same as database questions

## Yes/No Follow-up Fields (NEW!)
- **JSON Support**: Add `"follow_up"` field to Yes/No questions
- **Behavior**:
  - User clicks "Yes" → Text field appears below
  - Text field auto-focuses for immediate typing
  - User clicks "No" → Text field hides and clears
  - Follow-up text saved as: `Yes - [user text]` or just `No`
- **Example JSON**:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Have you observed skin reactions?",
    "type": "yesno",
    "follow_up": "Please specify the reactions"
  }
  ```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open a survey with Yes/No questions
- [ ] Click "Yes" - verify green highlight appears
- [ ] If follow-up defined, verify text field appears
- [ ] Type in follow-up field, then click "No" - verify field hides and clears
- [ ] Click "No" - verify green highlight appears
- [ ] Try to submit without filling all fields - verify error messages
- [ ] Fill all fields and submit - verify success
- [ ] Check database to confirm answers (with follow-up) are saved
- [ ] Upload new JSON survey - verify it works with new format
